Argument handling:
------------------

Required: source
        The program will load the image specified in "source".
        The image needs to be an 8-bit image.
        
Optional: destination -dest
        The script will save all results in "destination" if it is specified.
        Otherwise results are saved at the destination of the source image.
        
Optional: threshold_modifier -t
        The correct threshold for the thresholding process will be determined
        with Otsu's method. Nevertheless sometimes this process does not yield
        the best results and the threshold needs some manual tweaking. When
        processing a dataset, just look at the first few images, see if the
        binaries look good and if not, tweak the threshold a bit via the -t
        modifier.
        
Optional: minimum_feature_size -s
        If minimum_feature_size in pixels is specified, features with a size of
        up to minimum_feature_size will be removed from the binary image
        previous to processing. This serves to a) reduce the number of contours
        which will be processed and not needed in the end and b) helps the
        triangulation algorithm to not get confused when there are islands
        within holes.
        Defaults to 3000 pixels.

Optional: image_improvement -i
        If image_improvement is enabled, the binary image will be smoothed
        using binary opening and closing operations. The kernel size of said
        operations can be controlled by passing an integer along with the
        image_improvement option. The right kernel size is highly dependant on
        the resolution of the image. As a rule of thumb choose a kernel size
        below the width of the smallest feature in the image (in pixels).
        Defaults to 3 pixels.
