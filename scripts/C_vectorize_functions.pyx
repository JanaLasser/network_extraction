'''
Custom class for a point in 2D. Has x- and y coordinates as members.
Allows access to members via getters to reduce python overhead.
Implements __richcmp__ to allow for comparisons between points. A point is
larger than another point if its x- and y coordinates are larger than the 
other point's coordinates respectively. Two points are only equal if their
coordinates are equal (not if they are the same object!)     
Also implements a __str__ method for debugging reasons which allows to
visualize a point as "(x,y)".

'''        
Custom class for a segment in 2D. A segment consists of two Cpoints. Segments
are used to build triangles. A segment also stores pointers to the triangles 
it is part of to make later navigation easier. 
Implements __richcmp__ for comparisons. A segment is larger than another
segment if both its points are larger than the other segment's points.
Implements __str__ for debugging reasons which allows visualization of the
segment as "(x1,y1) -> (x2,y2)".
  
Exported methods:
   - get_triangle: returns a pointer to the first or second triangle a segment
                   is part of
   - set_triangle: exposes methods to python for setting of pointers to 
                   triangles
   - get_midpoint: returns a Cpoint object which lies in the middle of the
                   points the segment consists of
   - connects:     returns True if two segments share a point and false
                   otherwise
   - get_cp:       returns the shared point between two segments or None if
                   there is no shared point

'''
Custom class for a triangle in 2D.
Members:
    - edge_i:   Edges the triangle is constructed with
    - p_i:      Cpoints that span the triangle
    - typ:      type of the triangle (junction, normal, end or isolated)
    - centroid: "midpoint" of the triangle, point with the largest distance
                to the nearest edge of the foreground structure. It is only
                called "centroid" because of historical reasons :-)
    - diameter: distance to the nearest edge of the foreground structure
    - index:    counter used to fix the triangles position in a triangle
                adjacency matrix
    - neighbor: pointers to the triangles neighbors (3 to 0 possible neighbors)
                for junction, normal, end and isolated triangles. The pointers
                point to None at triangle construction and are set later by
                the triangle's "set_type" method.
    - Cpoints h, opp_point and half_ext_edge:
                helper points for the calculation of centroid and diameter

#in the list of points at index i,j and k.

#between triangles. The most efficient way to do this I could come up with
#is a lookup in a python dictionary (should scale O(1) on average).

#segments in a dictionary where the key is made up of the segment's point's
#coordinates like ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) and the value is the Csegment object.
#We make sure that we construct each segment only once. Then we use the 
#segments created this way to construct the triangles and set the neighborhood-
#relations accordingly.
